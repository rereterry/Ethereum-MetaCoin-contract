# Ethereum-MetaCoin-contract
Propose extensions to MetaCoin, implement them, and then write extensive test cases. 
If you work with two additional people, your extensions must be twice as substantial as if you were working with one additional perso n. 
Include a write up of your extensions, explaining how your implementation works. 
Be sure to use advanced features of Solidity that are not used by the original MetaCoin implementation.
